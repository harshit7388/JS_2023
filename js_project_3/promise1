/* 2 promises , one havibg time of 5 sec and another having time of 10sec. promise p1 and p2 are the two 
promises.
p1 is called first , then p2 is called .
then according to basic execution criteria, the p1 promised having time of 5sec will be logged and then 
p2 with time of 10sec will be logged.

but if we change the exection time , that is settimeout() values to for p1 10 sec and for p2 5 sec,
 then both the promises will be logged together after 10 sec, that means even if 1 promised is having 
 time of 5 seconds, the other prior promise with 10 sec time,is holding the exection of the other promise.
